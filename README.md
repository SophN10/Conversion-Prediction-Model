# User Conversion Prediction

This project analyses anonymised e-commerce user behaviour and site interaction data to predict whether a website visitor will convert (make a purchase).  
The objective is to demonstrate how applied machine learning can support data-driven decision-making in marketing and digital product optimisation.

---

## Problem Statement
Understanding which user behaviours lead to conversion allows organisations to:
- prioritise high-intent users  
- improve targeting and personalisation strategies  
- optimise website design and user journeys  

This project frames conversion prediction as a binary classification problem using behavioural and interaction-level features.

---

## Data Overview
The dataset contains anonymised user-level interaction data, including:
- browsing activity  
- clickstream events  
- engagement and purchase indicators  

The target variable indicates whether a user converted or not.  
Class imbalance is present and explicitly handled during modelling and evaluation.

---

## Approach
The project follows an end-to-end applied machine learning workflow:

### 1. Data Preparation & Exploration
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature scaling and transformation  
- Handling class imbalance  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

### 2. Model Development
Multiple models were trained and compared:
- Logistic Regression – baseline model for interpretability  
- Random Forest – to capture non-linear feature interactions  
- XGBoost – high-performance gradient boosting classifier  

### 3. Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using metrics suitable for imbalanced classification:
- Precision-Recall AUC (PR-AUC)  
- Precision, Recall and F1-score  

Performance trade-offs were assessed to align model choice with business objectives.

---

## Results & Evaluation
Model performance was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation, with ROC and precision-recall curves examined across folds to evaluate consistency and robustness.

The metrics below reflect representative performance observed across validation folds for the best-performing model:
- PR-AUC: 0.99  
- Precision: 0.94  
- Recall: 0.96  
- F1-score: 0.95  

These results indicate strong and stable performance in identifying high-intent users, while controlling false positives in an imbalanced classification setting.

---

## Model Explainability & Insights
Model explainability techniques were applied to ensure predictions could be interpreted and communicated effectively.

- Feature importance and SHAP values were used to identify the strongest drivers of conversion  
- Behavioural signals such as engagement intensity, browsing patterns, and purchase-related interactions were among the most influential features  

These insights help bridge model outputs with actionable business understanding and support stakeholder trust in the model.

Visualisations of feature importance and SHAP results are included in the accompanying presentation.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the `.R` scripts in RStudio (or another R IDE)  
3. Install required packages (e.g. tidyverse, caret, xgboost)  
4. Run scripts in order:  
   `01_data_cleaning_and_eda.R` → `02_model_training.R`

---

## Tools & Technologies
- R  
- tidyverse  
- caret  
- xgboost  
- Machine learning and model evaluation techniques  

---

## Limitations & Next Steps
- Incorporate additional session-level or temporal behavioural features  
- Operationalise the model by exposing predictions via a simple API or interactive dashboard for ongoing decision support
- Aggregate performance metrics and confusion matrices across validation folds to provide summary statistics and confidence in model stability

---

## Goal
To demonstrate an end-to-end applied machine learning project that connects user behaviour, predictive modelling, explainability, and business decision-making.
